# React.js TODO
Simple React.js web-application wit minimalistic design.
## About this app
This web application was made with [React.js](https://reactjs.org) open source library v.16.9 (latest at this moment). I used npm package called _create-react-app_.

This app has a very simple UI:
- One input field
- One list with a tasks
- And __sad__ puppy if you don't have any tasks :(

_Don't upset puppy_
